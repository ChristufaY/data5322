## 📝 Homework Summaries

### Homework 1: Tree-Based Models
Explore decision trees, random forests, and gradient-boosted trees for supervised learning tasks. The assignment focuses on:
- Training and tuning tree-based models
- Feature importance and model interpretability
- Evaluating model performance using cross-validation

### Homework 2: Support Vector Machines
This assignment investigates the use of linear and kernel SVMs in classification problems. It includes:
- Implementing and tuning SVMs with different kernels (linear, RBF)
- Visualization of decision boundaries
- Error analysis and parameter sensitivity

### Homework 3: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Apply CNNs to image classification tasks. This assignment includes:
- Building CNN architectures using PyTorch or TensorFlow
- Applying data augmentation and regularization techniques
- Evaluating model generalization on a test dataset
